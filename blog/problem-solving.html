    <h1>Probelm Solving</h1>

    <h2>Blocked on a simple problem:</h2>

    <p>I was stuck on the Scooby question. The problem was using the .find() method to find the hidden object ‘Scooby’. I used google to problem solve this question and understand the .find() method to use it in my code. I also looked on the threads in our discord chat to see the problem and how to get around it. I felt like I can do this and figure it out but with a bit more of support and help to get me through to fully understand it. I learned that I’m capable of achieving anything using problem solving skills and researching. 
    </p>

   

    <h2>Elegantly solved a problem</h2>

    <p>A problem in manipulating objects that I solved elegantly was in Q.6 in the task of deleting her eye-colour . I quickly googled ‘how to use the delete operator’ and passed the question. I felt proud of myself that I was able to use my problem solving skills to figure the task out efficiently and didn’t waste time. I learned how to use the delete operator in my code which will be helpful in the future. </p>
   
    <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>

    <p><b>Pseudocode -</b> Not very confident in using this method but am incorporating it in my daily tasks to make it stick and its very useful to help by writing it down in steps and following those steps to complete the task.<br>
      <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Trying something - </b>Feeling bit more confident in trying something and seeing where I went wrong and going back to fix it.<br>
       <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Rubber ducky method -</b> Very confident in using this method as it’s very useful. I use this often when I think I know the problem and saying it out loud to my little Smirf I have on my desk helps me get to the answer or close too!<br>
       <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Reading error messages - </b>Fairly confident in this method as I’m still trying to understand and learn how some of the methods and functions work and going back and trying it again.<br>
       <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Console.logging - </b>Fairly confident in using console.log just remembering to use it and checking back is what I need to work on but is a very useful technique.<br>
       <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Googling -</b> Very confident in using google as its one of my best friends now and is used 90% of the time when I’m stuck on a task or just need to quickly remember a syntax of something.<br> 
       <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Asking your peers for help -</b> Not very confident in this part as I normally leave it to the very last when all else fails and I’m really stuck on something but need to ask for help more.<br> 
       <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Asking coaches for help -</b> Fairly confident in asking my facilitators for anything as they’re very helpful and guide me back on the right track, but just that I do need to reach out when I’m stuck and don’t understand something.<br> 
       <p>-------------</p>
       <b>Improving your process with reflection - </b>Somewhat confident in this technique as I try go back and understand the problem and how I went wrong, what syntax was I using or what did I do incorrectly and always looking at how I can improve. </p>
       <p>-------------</p>
       
    
    <h2>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so</h2>
  
    <p>I normally would just ask for help once and get on with it, then not really ask for help again and feel stuck and just try google or other methods of problem solving rather then just asking for help because I feel like I’m asking a silly question or why don’t I understand this and nouns asked any questions on it but I need to learn that I’m not a coding genius just yet and this is my learning faze and need to ask as many questions as possible whenever I’m stuck. </p>

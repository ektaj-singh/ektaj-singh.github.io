        <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
        <p><b>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</b><br>
          I learned how to be grateful, how to relearn and learn new things, changed my mindset. During the core learning I realised that I have so much potential in me that I can do anything that I put my mind too and that its achievable. 
        </p>
        <p><b>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</b><br>
          Self-awareness in learning and programming is to take 5 move away from the screen for a bit go grab a coffee, this way we have time to recalculate our thought process and are able to complete the task or project. Values in learning and programming are being honest because if you don’t know anything or are stuck you just need to ask for help or else you’ll be there for hours on end trying to figure it out. 
          </p>
        <p><b>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</b><br>
          What surprised me the most about learning core is the way it changed my mindset and my thinking, its got me to a point where I’m cable off achieving anything I put my mind too and I know that I'm able to do it. It’s surprisingly changed my view own my life and my goals in a way of I have a clear window to my life and I know that I'm on the right path to succeed in met future. I also learned the importance ion having core not only in your work/ study place but to co-operate it in your daily life as-well.
        </p>
        <p><b>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</b><br>
          The most challenging aspect for me was thinking like a developer in where I had to change my whole mindset from what I had was a closed mindset to having an open mindset in where I’m willing to learn and progress over time. This was a big one for me as I was in a closed mindset for such a long time and having this change really opened my view of the world and of myself that anything is possible. I AM POSSIBLE.
        </p>
        <p><b>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</b><br>
          It’s a key aspect to have as not only does it change your mindset it make you grow into a better person and to also incorporate the growth mindset. "To be a good web developer, study code. To be a great one, study people." Joshua Vial, Founder of Dev Academy. What Joshua said is the reason why core is taught at Dev not only to become a programmer but to become the best programmer.
        </p>
        <p><b>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</b><br>
          NO! I’m very grateful and fortune to learn this way of thinking, I never thought that I could even think this way or even learn anything! Especially with technology! But core is what is making me into a better programmer and a better person day by day the values and the teachings in core really do change your mindset, it’s honestly one of the best things thats happened to me and I’m very grateful for the opportunity.

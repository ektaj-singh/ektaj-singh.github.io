    <h1>JS Fundamentals</h1>

    <h2>JavaScript, HTML & CSS</h2>
  
    <p><b>JavaScript</b> can be related to a cars engine as it provides power and functionalitly to make the vehcile go. In the same way JavaScript provides the functionality that makes web pages more dynamic and responsive.</p>

    <p><b>HTML</b> can be likened to the car's chassis, providing the structural foundation on which everything else is built. Just as the chassis determines the car's overall shape and size, HTML determines the basic structure and layout of a web page.</p>
  
    <p><b>CSS</b> can be compared to the car's paint job and interior design. It adds color, style, and visual appeal to the car, making it stand out from others. Similarly, CSS adds style and visual appeal to a web page, allowing developers to control the colors, fonts, and layout of various elements.</p>

   <h2>Control Flow & Loops</h2>

   <p><b>Control Flow</b> is a order in which instructions or steps are executed in a process. In cooking, control flow is important to ensure that ingredients are added and cooked in the right order to produce a tasty and well-cooked meal.</p>

   <p><b>Loops</b> on the other hand are repeating a set of instructions or steps multiple times. In cooking, loops are often used to repeat a particular step until a desired outcome is achieved.

    For example, when making pasta, you might use a loop to check the noodles for doneness</p>

    <h2>The DOM</h2>

    <p><b>Dom</b> (Document Object Model) is a programming interface that allows developers to interact with the HTML and the content of a web page. The DOM is a tree like structure in which it repersents the different elements of a web page.</p>
    <img class="DOM-tree" src="img/DOM-tree.png" alt="DOM">
    <p>The DOM allows you to modify web pages using programming languages like JavaScript. For instance, you can change the text of a heading or alter the color of a button. Moreover, you can use the DOM to add new elements to a web page, like a new item to a list, or remove existing ones, like a paragraph from a section of the web page. By using JavaScript to interact with the DOM, developers can create dynamic and interactive web pages that respond to user interactions and changes.</p>

    <h2>Arrays & Objects</h2>

    <p><b>Arrays</b> and <b>Objects</b> are two ways of storing and managing data in JavaScript. One difference between the two is that arrays have a defined order of elements, which can be accessed using their index numbers. Objects on the other hand are unordered collections of key-value pairs, so the order in which you access the properties is not guaranteed. For example you might use an array to store a list of names or numbers. An example of objects is storing a person's name, age, and address, where each piece of data is identified by a unique property name.</p>

    <h2>Functions</h2>

    <p><b>Functions</b> are blocks of code that can be defined and reused throughout a program. By writing a function once, you can call it multiple times instead of having to rewrite the same code every time you need to perform a particular task. This makes your code more efficient and easier to maintain.</p>

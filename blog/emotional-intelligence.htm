    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
    <h2><b>What is Emotional Intelligence?</b></h2>
    
    <p>
    Emotional Intelligence is a person’s ability to perceive, control, evaluate, demonstrate and empress their emotions to communicate and relate to others effectively. The ability of expressing and controlling your emotions is essential but so is the ability to understand, interpret and respond to the emotions of others. Some of the key signs of Emotional Intelligence (EQ) are self-confidence and self-acceptance, the ability to identify and describe what others are feeling and also the ability of letting go of mistakes. 

    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b>How is EQ different to IQ?</b><br>
      EQ is a person’s emotional quotient which generally refers to the persons ability to sense emotions in their self’s. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behaviour. In which you find it easier to identify emotions in yourself and others and communicate effectively with everyone. Whereas your IQ refers to your intellectual ability, which are planning and strategising, using logic to problem solve, learn and adapt to change and understand abstract ideas.     </p>
   
    <p>
<b>Why is EQ important?</b><br>
EQ is important for anyone who wants to be career ready as it helps in understanding your emotions and how to control them. Which allows you to communicate more effectively and forge stronger relationships  at work and in your personal life.

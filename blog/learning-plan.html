    <h1>Learning-Plan</h1>
    <h2>Here is my learning plan</h2>
    
    <p>
      What is your long term goal or career pathway? <br>
My long-term goal is to be a software engineer, in which I will always be learning and growing as a individual and also in a team environment which will essentially help me grow into the best version of myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning? <br>
My strengths are that I’m a very fast learning, I pick up on things quickly and especially if I get to see how its done as I’m a very visual leaner, my other strengths also include me being a attentive listener, someone who is open to ideas and gives feedback. My limitations are my lack of recapping and going over material multiple times this is something I struggle with and hope to improve on through my time at Dev.
    </p>
    <p>
      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy? <br>
I would like to build on my team leading and in-teams skills as I normally would just listen and get on with it, I would like to interact more and get more feedback not only to help myself but also my teammates.
    </p>
    <p>
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. <br>
How I manage myself is by having discipline and I follow this very religiously because this has helped me in the past to get me to where I am today, this isn’t something you just say and it magically happens. For me this is something I have to do every single day to make it as easy as waking up and brushing my teeth, through that is how I manage myself by doing the same steps everyday and achieving each small win through out my day. When things stat to build up as they did for me in this task as my website looks like my younger brother had made it, I take 5 or sometimes even 10 to destress myself have 5 - 10 minutes with myself and get back onto it and also ask in discord as it was very helpful to me. I also have one other commitment of gym, to keep myself fit and my mind clear is the way I think of it and also being fit and healthy is fun. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way. <br>
To seek help for anything I ask my discord group and also my facilitators as they are always very helpful and lead me back on track when I do encounter a hiccup. Also have Google who has lately been my best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team. <br>
The facilitations team is outstanding honestly, one of the friendliest and easy to talk to people I have ever meet and also to note that they a very helpful especially someone like me who doesn’t know anything about computers. They are Web Legends!

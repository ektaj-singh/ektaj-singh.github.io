    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths </h1>
    
    <p>
      After four long years in trades, I decided I needed a career change. I thought about what I wanted my future to look like and asked myself what I actually wanted to do as a job, to be free from working 60 plus hours a week. This meant I'd not have time for myself, let alone my friends and family. I knew I had to be determined to have a clear idea of where I'm aiming to be in the future. I couldn’t be more happier to have taken the decision I did. I trust I’m on the road to success and am finally using my full potentially in something I enjoy.

      My background is Panjabi. I was born in NZ and I hold honesty and trust as some of the core values I was taught in the cultural aspect of my life. I have a small circle of friends which built my values of discipline and courage. Stepping out of my comfort zone has shaped me into a much better person than I was a year ago. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My strengths are being disciplined, hardworking and my willingness to learn something new. This will help me immensely in my learning journey. 
    </p>
<p>
  I truly think I have no limitations. I consider myself as an open-minded person who's willing to learn and develop the human skills necessary to my journey of learning and career.

    An example of using strategies and discussing a plan is when I was working in a team in Masterton. One of my team mates didn’t complete the job and tasks given. At the time, we had just had a meeting to discuss the schedule and what we needed to get the job done before the deadline. The discussion didn't really go far as the same issue happened meaning we were behind the deadline. What I would do now is have a open discussion with my team mates regarding what’s wrong and why tasks aren’t being completed or to the best of their ability. Discussing where we could work better as a team, find a better solution or a better suited task for the person to do and complete.

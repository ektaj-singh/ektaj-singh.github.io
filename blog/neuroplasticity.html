    <h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

    <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>

    <p>Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity will benefit anyone who is willing to follow the steps. Theses steps are here to improve the persons well being and overall their brain functions for example the old saying practice makes perfect but it actually should say is practise makes permanent.</p>

    <p>-------------</p>

    <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h2>

    <p>I will engage with the principles of neuroplasticity, in my daily life. One of the many things I like to do is go to the gym and at the gym their is one principle I will be using of neuroplasticity which is “Use it and Improve it” This principle does exactly what it tells us, for example if I were to increase my cardio I’d have to do cardio related exercises till there was a point were I wouldn’t feel fatigued or puffed up. </p>
   
    <p>-------------</p>

    <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>

    <p>One of the ways is my example from the gym using the “Use it and Improve it” principle to gain more muscle or increase your cardio. Another way is “Repetition Matters” which I will be using mostly as I’m new to the tech world and will be going over and over a lot of material, which will help me retain the information for longer and lodge it in my long-term memory.</p>

    <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h2>
  
    <p>A growth mindset is to understand and recognise their abilities and talents which can be improved over time by achieving small wins repetitively which can lead to a growth mindset. I believe this is relevant because I can relate to this type of mindset. Before I started my journey with Dev I had a fixed mindset to where I was stuck in one place and not growing. Since joining dev, my mindset has changed into one which grows than rather staying fixed. It’s determined to have small wins which will lead me to achieve bigger things in life.</p>

   <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>

   <p>Yes, I was shocked to understand and see that I do have a growth mindset, as someone who had a fixed mindset for majority of my life. </p>

   <p>-------------</p>

    <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>

    <p>As someone with no knowledge or experience in this field of work, I must integrate my growth mindset to complete this course. </p>

<h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h2>

<p>Having a growth mindset and understanding the principles of neuroplasticity have made me understand myself better to know where my mindset is and what I can do to improve on things for myself. This has helped me to understand that I’m on the correct path and does correlate to my learning plan. </p>

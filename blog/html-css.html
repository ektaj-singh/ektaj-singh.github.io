        <h2>What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?</h2>
        <p>Inline elements are those that are displayed in a single line, one after the other. They are typically used for smaller pieces of content, such as text or images. Examples of inline elements include links, images, and spans.

    Inline-block elements, on the other hand, behave like inline elements in that they are displayed in a single line, but they can also have their width and height set like block-level elements. This means that they can be used for larger pieces of content, such as forms or videos.


<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
<p>
In conclusion, understanding the differences between inline and inline-block elements can help you create more effective and visually appealing web pages. While inline elements are best used for small pieces of content that should flow within a block-level element, inline-block elements are ideal for creating columns or grids of content.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello Everyone, welcome to my webiste! 
          <br>My name is Ektaj, I’m orginally from the heart of sunny Hawke’s Bay Hastings, were I was born and raised. But now live at Taita in this windy city. The things I value are discipline, kindness, caring, creative and innovative. The reason I’m attending Dev is because I hated my job I was a welder for 4 years and its just not the life I want I know I have so much more potential in me to become so much more and grow as a person. I also am very grateful for my mentor/big brother/landlord who is already a software engineer to introduce me to Dev and really just to figure myself out and see that I can do anything I put my mind to. 
          <br>I'll be uploading my blogs throug my journey at Dev Academy. </p>
